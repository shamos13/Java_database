This is a small fun practice project which Mimics the car rental system. 
The purpose of this project is to challenge my understanding of Java's OOP concepts and Dependency injection, which gears me towards 
becoming a Springboot developer.
This project was entirely built using raw java (without a framework), JDBC (for database connectivity) and uses Maven for Dependency Management. 
Interaction with this program is mainly from the terminal.

The main entry point for this program is from the main class.
